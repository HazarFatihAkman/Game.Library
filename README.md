# Game.Library
A game library app that's shows you installed Steam, Epic, Amazon and etc. games on your pc.

### Goal
I often get lost in the clutter of icons or forgot what I installed to play later.
So I decided to make this app for quickly seeing which games are installed without requiring you to open the launchers.

### Usage
You don't need to install anything or link any of your account.
Just click run on desktop and ensure there's a "Games" folder exists on your desktop and game shortcuts are inside.
An app doesn't require to access your any accounts, it's only scan "Games" folder and shows you what's installed.

### Features

- Showing game covers with names
- Run game (it's gonna run shortcut)
- Search bar (Planned future feature)
- Descending (Planned future feature)
- Last 10 games you played (Planned future feature)
